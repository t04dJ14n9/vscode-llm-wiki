## Abstract

Multi-query attention (MQA), which only uses a single key-value head, drastically speeds up decoder inference. However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.

A    Training Stability
We find that multi-query attention can lead to train-
ing instability during fine-tuning, in particular com-
bined with long input tasks. We trained multiple
T5-Large models with multi-query attention from
scratch. In each case, pre-training suffered from
frequent loss spikes and the final models diverged
immediately when fine-tuning on long-input tasks.
Uptrained multi-query attention models are more
stable but still display high variance, so for multi-
query models on unstable tasks we report average
performance over three fine-tuning runs. Uptrained
grouped-query attention models, however, appear
to be stable, so we did not investigate futher on the
root causes of multi-query instability.
