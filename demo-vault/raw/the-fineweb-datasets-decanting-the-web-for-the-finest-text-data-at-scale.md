## Abstract

The performance of a large language model (LLM) depends heavily on the quality and size of its pretraining dataset. However, the pretraining datasets for state-of-the-art open LLMs like Llama 3 and Mixtral are not publicly available and very little is known about how they were created. In this work, we introduce FineWeb, a 15-trillion token dataset derived from 96 Common Crawl snapshots that produces better-performing LLMs than other open pretraining datasets. To advance the understanding of how best to curate high-quality pretraining datasets, we carefully document and ablate all of the design choices used in FineWeb, including in-depth investigations of deduplication and filtering strategies. In addition, we introduce FineWeb-Edu, a 1.3-trillion token collection of educational text filtered from FineWeb. LLMs pretrained on FineWeb-Edu exhibit dramatically better performance on knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks like MMLU and ARC. Along with our datasets, we publicly release our data curation codebase and all of the models trained during our ablation experiments.

                                         1   Introduction
                                         Large Language Models (LLMs) have quickly become a ubiquitous technology thanks to their ability
                                         to competently perform a wide range of text-based tasks. A driving factor in the success of LLMs
                                         has been a steady increase in model sizes [1–3], which in turn necessitate ever-larger pretraining
                                         datasets. Beyond scale, other characteristics of pretraining data have proven to be important, including
                                         filtering out “low-quality” content [2, 4] and removing duplicate text [5]. Ultimately, the curation
                                         choices made when developing a pretraining dataset can have a huge impact on the downstream
                                         capabilities and performance of an LLM. As such, pretraining dataset curation strategies are often
                                         treated as closely guarded trade secrets. In fact, there are many popular “open” language models
                                         whose parameters are publicly available but whose pretraining datasets were not released and are
                                         scarcely documented [6, 7]. The lack of access to high-quality large-scale pretraining datasets and
                                         lack of information about their curation has led to concerns of a growing gap between proprietary
                                         and public knowledge.
                                         In this work, we aim to minimize this gap by developing and releasing the FineWeb datasets, a
                                         collection of large-scale pretraining datasets that can be used to train performant LLMs. Specifically,
                                         we first introduce FineWeb, a 15-trillion token dataset of text sourced from 96 Common Crawl
                                         snapshots. FineWeb is sufficiently large to train a Chinchilla-optimal model [1] with more than
                                         500 billion parameters. Beyond scale, FineWeb’s recipe involves a principled strategy for choosing
                                         and tuning filtering heuristics that helped produce a small set of effective filters out of over fifty
                                         candidate filters from past work. In addition, we performed an in-depth exploration of how different
                                         deduplication strategies and granularities can impact performance. To validate our design choices,
                                         we ultimately demonstrate that models trained on FineWeb perform better than those trained on other

public web-based pre-training datasets. Inspired by recent work advocating for training LLMs on
educational data [8, 9], we additionally introduce FineWeb-Edu, a subset of 1.3 trillion tokens from
FineWeb that was rated as highly educational by a custom classifier. Models trained on FineWeb-Edu
exhibit significantly better performance on knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks like
MMLU [10] and ARC [11]. Both datasets are released under the permissive ODC-By License. Apart
from contributing datasets, we also release datatrove [12], the data processing library we developed
to create FineWeb. On the whole, our work represents a significant step towards improving public
knowledge and resources for curating LLM pre-training datasets.

2    Background
In this work, we focus on the curation of training datasets for autoregressive Transformer-based large
language models (LLMs) [13]. At their core, LLMs aim to produce a distribution over the next token
of text conditioned on past tokens, where each token is typically a word or subword unit [3]. The
generality of this paradigm allows LLMs to be applied to virtually any text-based task by formulating
a prefix whose continuation corresponds to performing the task (e.g. “The cat sat on the mat translated
to French is...” for English-to-French translation). Such models may undergo many stages of training
including pretraining on unstructured text data, fine-tuning to improve performance on a specific
task [14], multitask fine-tuning to improve generalization to new tasks [15], and learning from human
feedback to improve instruction-following capabilities [16, 2]. In this work, we focus solely on
curating data for the pretraining stage.
While many sources have been considered for pretraining data including text from books [2, 3, 17, 4],
Wikipedia [2, 3, 17, 4], and research papers [2, 4, 18], a highly common choice is to use web
text, i.e. text scraped from webpages on the public internet [19, 20]. While some companies like
OpenAI [21] and Anthropic [22] perform their own web scrapes, designing, implementing, and
running a web scraper at scale requires significant resources and expertise. Many LLM pretraining
datasets have therefore been constructed from text from the Common Crawl [23], a publicly available
and continually updated collection of website snapshots that has been running since 2007. As of
writing, Common Crawl has produced 100 web snapshots totaling petabytes of data.
Although Common Crawl has produced more than enough data to train recent LLMs, it has been
shown that the performance of an LLM can heavily depend on how web text has been filtered and
preprocessed before being used for pretraining [19]. In particular, web text can contain a large amount
of “unnatural” language (e.g. “boilerplate” text, gibberish, etc.). Training on unnatural language
data can harm the performance of LLMs, possibly because most downstream uses of LLMs do not
involve such data. On the other hand, filtering out too much content can produce a dataset that is
too small to perform sufficient pretraining (which typically involves only one pass or a few passes
over the pretraining dataset [24]) for a general use model. Separately, web text can contain a large
amount of duplicated content, which has also been shown to be harmful in the context of pretraining
data [5]. While deduplication may seem as straightforward as “removing duplicate text”, in practice
many design choices must be made (line, paragraph, or document-level deduplication? fuzzy or
exact matching? etc.). The curation and relative performance of different web text-based pretraining
datasets therefore heavily depends on a given dataset’s filtering and deduplication pipeline.
Given that the focus of our work is to carefully design an effective Common Crawl-based pre-
training dataset, we now briefly discuss the filtering and deduplication used in past public datasets.
OSCAR [25] processes Common Crawl using a pipeline inspired by that of Touvron et al. [2],
which uses a fastText-based language classifier [26] to filter pages based on their language and then
performs deduplication at the line level using a non-cryptographic hash algorithm. C4 [15] uses
langdetect [27] to filter out non-English pages, then applies a series of heuristic filters (retaining
only those lines that end in a terminal punctuation mark, removing short lines, discarding any page
that contains a word from a “bad words” list, etc.), and finally deduplicates over three-line windows.
CC-100 [28] uses the cc_net pipeline, which includes fastText for language identification, performs
paragraph-level hash-based deduplication, and retains only the text that is assigned a low perplexity
by a n-gram language model trained on Wikipedia. The Pile [29] is a composite dataset that includes
“Pile-CC”, a collection of text from one Common Crawl snapshot that uses pycld2 [30] for language
detection, jusText [31] for boilerplate removal, a classifier to filter out pages that are dissimilar form
WebText (described below), and fuzzy deduplication using MinHash [32]. ROOTS [33] includes text
from the pre-processed web crawl OSCAR with additional heuristic-based filtering and SimHash-


                                                    2
based deduplication. RedPajama [34] is a composite dataset that includes Common Crawl-sourced
text processed using the cc_net pipeline as well as quality filtering using a classifier trained to
distinguish Wikipedia level content from random Common Crawl samples. SlimPajama [35] further
processed RedPajama by removing short documents and performing additional fuzzy MinHash-based
deduplication. RefinedWeb [36] uses trafilatura [37] for text extraction, fastText for language
identification, heuristic rules inspired by MassiveText (discussed below) to filter data, and both
MinHash (fuzzy) and ExactSubstr (exact) deduplication. RedPajama v2 [34] has 84 Common
Crawl snapshots released unfiltered and non-deduplicated but with labels from filtering techniques
from cc_net, C4, MassiveText, RefinedWeb and others, as well as deduplication labels for exact
(Bloom filter) and fuzzy (MinHash) deduplication. Finally, Dolma [38] has a Common Crawl-based
subset that uses fastText for language classification, heuristic rules from MassiveText and C4 for
quality filtering, rules- and classifier-based toxicity filtering, and URL, document and paragraph-level
deduplication using a Bloom filter.
Apart from public datasets, the technical reports accompanying the announcement of closed LLMs
occasionally discuss pretraining datasets. WebText [20] (used to train GPT-2) involves only those
non-Wikipedia webpages that were linked to from Reddit posts with at least 3 karma, with text
extracted using Dragnet [39] and Newspaper1 [40] and an unspecified deduplication pipeline. GPT-
3’s Dataset [3] includes content from Common Crawl that has been filtered using a classifier trained
on WebText, Wikipedia, and Books, and deduplicated using MinHash. MassiveText [41] (used
to train Gopher) is a web-based dataset using Google’s SafeSearch to remove explicit content and
heuristic filters based on document’s content (number of words, stop-words appearance, character
repetition, etc.) as well as MinHash-based deduplication.

3     Building FineWeb
Our design of FineWeb is primarily empirical: we performed a series of “data ablation” experiments
to test different methods at each stage of the pipeline. In this section, we chronicle our experimental
results and design choices. All ablations follow our iterative dataset building process, i.e., the baseline
model for each subsection includes only the processing steps from the previous subsections, unless
explicitly mentioned. Our results are fully reproducible with code in our datatrove repository.

3.1   Experimental setup

We compare pipeline design choices at each stage by training data ablation models that are identical
apart from the data they were trained on (same number of parameters, architecture hyper-parameters,
and trained on an equal number of randomly sampled tokens from each version of the data). We
then evaluated them on the same set of downstream task benchmark datasets (discussed below). To
minimize the impact of random data subset selection on evaluation scores, we trained two models
for each dataset version, each using a different but equal-sized random subset of the full data and a
different initialization seed, and then compared average scores.
All training was performed using the nanotron library. Data ablation models all had 1.71B parame-
ters (including embeddings), used the Llama architecture [2] with a sequence length of 2048, a global
batch size of ~2 million tokens, and the GPT2 tokenizer [20]. Within a given experiment, all models
were trained on the same amount of data for the same number of steps. Filtering ablations were trained
on ~28 billion tokens (roughly the Chinchilla-optimal training size for this model size [1]), while
some deduplication ablations and runs to confirm cumulative relative performance improvements
after each step of filtering were conducted on 350 billion tokens. The full training hyperparameter
are available in Appendix D. We make all models trained for our ablations publicly available on our
dataset repository. In total, we trained over 70 models on our internal cluster, for an estimated total of
80,000 H100 GPU hours.
Evaluation was performed using the lighteval library. We aimed to select a set of benchmarks
that would provide good signal at the relatively small scale of our data ablations. Specifically, we
chose benchmarks where models showed minimal score variance between runs trained on different
random samples of the same dataset; monotonic (or nearly monotonic) score improvement over
a given training; and scores above random baseline for models of this size. These criteria ensure
that the scores obtained on a subset of the data are representative of the entire dataset and that they
reflect a reliable measurement of the effect of the training data on model performance. Ultimately,


                                                    3
    we selected benchmark datasets CommonSense QA [42], HellaSwag [43], OpenBook QA [44],
    PIQA [45], SIQA [46], WinoGrande [47], ARC [11], and MMLU [10], truncating large benchmarks
    to 1000 samples so that we could efficiently evaluate over the course of training. We publicly release
    our exact evaluation setup.

     3.2                  Text extraction

    Common Crawl data is available in two different formats: WARC and WET. WARC (Web ARChive
    format) files contain the raw data from the crawl, including the full page HTML and request metadata.
    WET (WARC Encapsulated Text) files provide a text-only version of crawled websites by using
    htmlparser [48]. While WET files are commonly used as a starting point for dataset creation,
    similarly to Gao et al. [29], we found that WET files retained too much boilerplate and menu text.
    We therefore experimented with extracting the text content from the WARC files using the open
    source trafilatura library [49], which from visual inspection of the results provided good quality
    extraction when compared to other available libraries (less boilerplate and menu text). Custom
    text extraction is relatively costly, but its effects are felt on model performance: Fig. 1 shows the
    performance of ablation models trained on either trafilatura applied to WARC data or WET data, with
    minimal additional filtering (fastText language identification to filter samples with English as the
    highest probability label) and no deduplication. Using trafilatura-extracted text from WARC files
    clearly results in a more performant model and we therefore use WARC-based data in all of our
    following experiments.

                                                                                                         42

       language filtering.


     3.3                  Base filtering

    As a starting point to our filtering, we applied a basic filtering pipeline using part of the setup from
    RefinedWeb [50]. Concretely, we applied URL filtering using a blocklist [51] to remove adult content,
    applied a fastText language classifier [52, 26] to keep only English text with a score >= 0.65, and
    applied quality and repetition filters from MassiveText [41], using the original thresholds. After
    applying this filtering to all of the WARC-based text extracted from the 96 snapshots available at
    the time of writing, we obtained roughly 36 trillion tokens of data when tokenized with the GPT-2
    tokenizer. Applying these steps results in a performance uplift, as seen in Fig. 2.

     3.4                  Deduplication

    The web has many aggregators, mirrors, templated pages or just otherwise repeated content spread
    over different domains and webpages. Removing these duplicates (deduplicating) has been correlated
    with improvements in model performance [5] and a reduction in memorization of pretraining data [53,
    54]. There are different ways to identify and even define duplicated data. Common approaches rely
    on hashing techniques or efficient data structures like suffix arrays [55]. Methods can also be “fuzzy”
    by using a similarity metric or “exact” by checking for exact matches between two text chunks [56].


                                                                                 4
     Following RefinedWeb [50], we experimented with MinHash, a fuzzy hash-based deduplication
     technique that scales efficiently to many CPU nodes and allows tuning of similarity thresholds (by
     controlling the number and the number of hashes per bucket) as well as the length of the subsequences
     considered (by controlling the n-gram size). We chose to collect each document’s 5-grams, obtained
     using an English word tokenizer [57], and computed MinHashes using 112 hash functions in total,
     split into 14 buckets of 8 hashes each — targeting documents that are at least 75% similar. Documents
     with the same 8 MinHashes in any bucket are considered duplicates of each other. We then perform a
     transitive clustering step where documents A, B and C will be in the same duplicate cluster if A and
     C are duplicates and B and C are duplicates, even if A and B do not have 8 matching MinHashes in
     any bucket with each other. One (randomly chosen) document is kept per duplicate cluster while the
     remaining duplicates are removed. We further discuss deduplication parameters in Appendix E.1.

     Our first approach was to apply MinHash deduplication globally to the entire dataset (all 96 snapshots).
     We did this in an iterative manner: starting with the most recent snapshot (2023-50, at the time the
     experiment was run) and proceeding chronologically until we reached the oldest snapshot. When
     applied to the oldest snapshots, this process removed as much as 90% of the original base filtered
     data, as they were deduplicated against a large number of other snapshots. Deduplicating the entire
     dataset in this manner resulted in 4 trillion tokens of data. However, when training on a randomly
     sampled 350 billion tokens subset, our ablation models showed little improvement over a model
     trained on the non-deduplicated data, scoring far below RefinedWeb on our aggregate of tasks, as
     shown in Fig. 3.
     This challenged our initial assumption that global deduplication would inevitably result in higher
     benchmark scores. We therefore performed an additional experiment to investigate the quality of
     the remaining data. We trained two models on two slices from the older 2013-48 snapshot: (a) the
     fully deduplicated remaining ~31 billion tokens (originally kept data); and (b) 171 billion tokens
     obtained by individually deduplicating (without considering the other crawls) the ~460 billion tokens
     that had been removed from this crawl in the iterative deduplication process (originally removed
     data). Results are presented in Fig. 4. They show that, for this older crawl taken in isolation, the data
     from it that was kept (10% of the original data) was actually of worse quality than the 90% of data
     that was removed. We confirmed this by visual inspection: originally kept data contains more ads,
     incoherent lists of keywords and generally badly formatted text than originally removed data.
     We therefore tried an alternative approach: individually deduplicating each snapshot (independently
     from the others), using the same parameters as before. This resulted in 20 trillion tokens of data.
     When training on a random sample from this dataset (with data sampled from all snapshots) it
     matched RefinedWeb’s performance, as per Fig. 5.
      One of our hypotheses is that the main improvement gained from deduplication lies in the removal of
      large clusters of duplicates with hundreds of thousands of documents [50] present in all crawls, while
      further deduplication of clusters with a small number of duplicates (less than ~100, i.e., the number



                                                                                 5
      of crawls) can harm performance. More specific filtering targeting the long tail of data quality might
      be more suited than deduplication for this subset of the data.
      To attempt to improve upon individual dedu-
      plication of each snapshot, we additionally ex-
      perimented with “lighter” global deduplication                                                          48

      C4 was constructed from the 2019-18 crawl by applying heuristic filters, which included drop-
      ping lines without a terminal punctuation mark, that mentioned javascript, or that had “terms-of-
      use”/“cookie policy” statements, and dropping documents that were too short or that contained “lorem
      ipsum” or a curly bracket ({). We experimented with applying these filters to a baseline of the base
      filtered and individually deduplicated 2019-18 crawl, and, additionally, compared the results to C4
      itself.
      Fig. 6 shows that applying All filters allows us to match C4’s HellaSwag performance; the Curly
      bracket filter, and the Word lengths filter only give a small boost, removing 2.8% and 4.3% of tokens,
      respectively; the Terminal punctuation filter, by itself, gives the biggest individual boost, but removes
      around 30% of all tokens; the lorem_ipsum, javascript and policy rules each remove <0.5% of
      training tokens, so we did not train on them individually; All but terminal punct performs better
      than terminal_punct by itself, while removing less in total (~7%). We decided to apply all C4 filters
      mentioned above except the terminal punctuation filter, as it eliminates an excessively large amount
      of data.

3.6        Developing additional heuristic filters

Past work has mainly developed heuristic filters through data inspection [15]. In this work we devised
a more systematic process for designing heuristic filters and tuning their thresholds. We started by
collecting over 50 high-level statistics ranging from document-level metrics (e.g. number of lines,
avg. line/word length, etc) to inter-document repetition metrics (inspired by MassiveText [1]) on both
a high- and low-quality web dataset. Specifically, we used the individually and globally deduplicated
versions of the 2013-48 snapshot (previously mentioned in Section 3.4) as our “high-quality” and
“low-quality” datasets respectively. We then identified metrics for which the distribution of values
differed significantly across the two datasets, inspected the histograms of the two distributions and
empirically chose thresholds that would target sections of the histogram where the lower quality
dataset frequency was higher than on the corresponding higher quality dataset section. As an example,
we plot the distribution of the fraction of lines ending with punctuation metric in Fig. 8. We can
see that the higher quality dataset has in general higher document density for larger values of our
metric, and, in particular, the lower quality dataset has a much higher density of documents for values
< 0.12. We thus conclude that documents with a fraction of lines ending with punctuation < 0.12 are
generally lower quality and use this value as a tentative threshold to filter documents. Following this
process for all metrics yielded 16 candidate metric-threshold pairs.
We then assessed the effectiveness of these 16
newly created filters by conducting several 28B                   Filtered out
token ablation runs on the 2019-18 crawl. Full de-

significant improvements on the aggregate bench-         4

documents where the fraction of lines ending with        2

further improve performance and, notably, surpass

3.7        The final FineWeb dataset

Combining the decisions made in the previous sections and applying the resulting pipeline to 96
Common Crawl snapshots produces the 15T-token FineWeb dataset. Specifically, we extract text from
WARC files (Section 3.2), apply base filtering (Section 3.3), perform individual per-crawl MinHash
deduplication (Section 3.4), apply a selection of C4 filters (Section 3.5), and finally apply custom
filters (Section 3.6). Each step provides a relative performance boost on our group of benchmark
tasks, as seen in Fig. 9. For the public release of the dataset, we have also applied Personal Identifiable
Information (PII) removal, by anonymizing email and public IP addresses.
In Fig. 10 we compare FineWeb with the following commonly used openly accessible web-scale
datasets: RefinedWeb (500B tokens) [50], C4 (172B tokens) [15]; the Common Crawl-based part of
Dolma 1.6 (3T tokens) and 1.7 (1.2T tokens) [58], The Pile (340B tokens) [29], SlimPajama (627B
tokens) [35], the deduplicated variant of RedPajama21 (20T tokens) [34], English CommonCrawl
section of Matrix (1.3T tokens) [59], English CC-100 (70B tokens) [60], and Colossal-OSCAR
(850B tokens) [61]. Notably, FineWeb shows strong performance and FineWeb-Edu (detailed below)
outperforms all other open datasets we compared on our aggregate group of tasks, further validating

      4                  FineWeb-Edu
     An interesting approach has recently emerged for filtering LLM training datasets: using synthetic
     data to develop classifiers for identifying educational content. This technique was notably used in
     the non-public pretraining datasets of Llama 3 [6] and Phi-3 [8], but its large-scale impact on web
     data filtering has not been publicly explored. We applied this technique to FineWeb by filtering it
     with an educational quality classifier developed from synthetic annotations generated by Llama-3-
     70B-Instruct [62]. The resulting dataset, FineWeb-Edu, contains 1.3 trillion tokens. FineWeb-Edu
     is specifically optimized for educational content and outperforms all openly accessible web-based
     datasets on a number of reasoning- and knowledge-intensive benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC, and
     OpenBookQA by a significant margin.
     To build the synthetic annotations, we use Llama-3-70B-Instruct to score 460,000 randomly sampled
     webpages from the FineWeb CC-MAIN-2024-10 snapshot for their educational quality on a scale
     from 0 to 5. We explored several prompt formats to automatically extract an educational score using
     an LLM and found that the additive scale used in previous work Yuan et al. [63] worked best. It
     allows the LLM to evaluate each criterion and build the score step-by-step, unlike the single-rating
     scale [64] which assigns a fixed score based on predefined categories. To avoid having the LLM favor
     highly technical pages like arXiv abstracts and submissions, we prompted it to focus on grade-school
     and middle-school level knowledge. The prompt used for synthetic annotations is in Appendix F.1.
     To scale our filtering to the entirety of FineWeb, we trained a linear regression model on top of the
     Snowflake-arctic-embed-m embedding model [65]. We fine-tuned this linear regressor on 410,000
     of our Llama 3 synthetic annotations for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 3e-4 (while keeping the
     embedding and encoder layers frozen). We selected the checkpoint with the highest F1 score on
     the held-out validation set containing the remaining 50,000 samples, treating Llama 3 annotations
     as ground-truth. After training, we rounded the model’s output scores to integers from 0 to 5. We
     then used fixed thresholds to classify whether a given document from FineWeb was educational. We
     investigated the impact of using different thresholds for the filtering and ultimately chose a minimum
     threshold of 3 for FineWeb-Edu, which ultimately gave the best trade-off between performance
     on knowledge and reasoning intensive benchmarks and the performance on other benchmarks like
     HellaSwag [66]. With a threshold of 3, the model achieved an F1 score of 82% on the validation set,
     indicating strong performance in distinguishing high-quality educational content.
     Applying the classifier to the 15 trillion tokens of FineWeb required 6,000 H100 GPU hours.
     To confirm the effectiveness of education filtering at a larger scale, we conducted a larger ablation
     training a 1.71B model on 350 billion tokens, similar to the FineWeb filtering ablations mentioned


                                                                                8
above. As shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, we observed that FineWeb-Edu surpasses FineWeb and all
other open web datasets, with quite remarkable improvements on educational benchmarks such as
MMLU, ARC and OpenBookQA. Specifically, MMLU score increases from 33% to 37%, a relative
improvement of approximately 12%, and ARC score goes from 46% to 57%, an improvement of
about 24%.
On MMLU, FineWeb-Edu can match the final
performance of Matrix with almost 10x fewer to-                         38

we plot the difference of the size (as a percentage
of the entire dataset) of each cluster in FineWeb-
Edu and FineWeb in Fig. 18. The educational
classifier heavily favors topics such as ’Education,
Learning, Teaching’ or ’History, Culture, Politics’, while down-sampling ’Business, Finance, Law’,
’Entertainment, Film, Theater’ and ’Places, Travel, Real Estate’, among others.

4.2   Domain fit

We evaluate the macro average perplexity of six checkpoints from our FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu
ablation models on the domains from Paloma [71]. We use the codebase provided in [71] but
intentionally do not perform decontamination, to compare how well each dataset covers different
domains. The results are in Fig. 12. The FineWeb model generally shows lower perplexity in broad
web sources such as C4, mC4, Falcon, Dolma V1.5 or the CommonCrawl subset of RedPajama,
as well as on Twitter AAE, Manosphere, Gab, reddit (100 Subreddits) or 4chan. FineWeb-Edu
tends to favour sources containing Wikipedia (WikiText-103 and M2D2 Wikipedia) or that are heavy
in academic content (M2D2 S2ORC, which has semantic scholar papers, and the Arxiv subset of
RedPajama). FineWeb-Edu also seems to have better coverage of programming content (100 PLs)
than FineWeb. We have included results per subset for some of these sources in Appendix F.4.

5     Bias analyses
Language models are known to reflect the biases present in their pretraining datasts [72–77]. To pro-
vide a brief picture of dataset bias in FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu, we focus on subgroups recognised
as “sensitive” or “protected” in English-speaking countries. These are a subset of subgroups that are
historically subject to discrimination and are disproportionately the target of negative societal norms
such as stereotyping, which is reflected in text-based language consumed for a dataset. We find that
the FineWeb dataset has a relative overrepresentation of words that reflect hegemonic norms, known
to be overrepresented in online text [72], such as ‘man’ and ‘christian’. Although biases across the
gender, religion, and age subgroups examined are not strong, we see the most skewed association
between religion words and intimacy, such as ‘christian dating’ and ‘jewish singles’. Fittingly, the
FineWeb-Edu dataset captures associations that are less tied to intimacy compared to FineWeb and
more expected from educational content of history and health, such as ‘man’ being associated to
‘king’, and ‘woman’ associated to ‘pregnancy’. Further details are provided in Appendix G.

   6                        Conclusion
   In this paper, we developed the FineWeb datasets, a collection of large-scale LLM pretraining datasets
   that produce performant LLMs. Specifically, we release FineWeb, a 15-trillion token dataset derived
   from 96 Common Crawl snapshots, as well as FineWeb-Edu, a 1.3-trillion token dataset of educational
   content from FineWeb. FineWeb was created through a series of experiments that provided empirical
   evidence for our choice of text extraction strategy, deduplication procedure, and content filters. Both
   datasets are publicly released, along with the code and processing library that we used and all of the
   models we trained during our dataset ablation experiments.
  While FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu attain state-of-the-art performance among public LLM pretraining
  datasets, we identify various paths to further improvement. First, both datasets are entirely comprised
  of web content scraped by Common Crawl. It is possible that augmenting either datasets with other
  datatypes (books, speech transcripts, etc.) could further improve performance. In addition, most of
  the experiments we ran were at a smaller scale due to computational constraints. Designing datasets
  at more realistic scales could provide more reliable guidance. Our evaluation setup was also by
  necessity limited to performance on academic benchmarks without any further instruction tuning
  or alignment. An evaluation setup that better reflected current usage patterns of LLMs might also
  be more reliable. We hope that our released datasets, code, and models help further improve public
  knowledge and development of performant LLM pretraining datasets.

                                     Dataset Creation
Curation Rationale                            With FineWeb, we aim to provide the open source
                                              community with a clean and large-scale dataset for
                                              pretraining performant large language models.
Source Data                                   The source data consists of webpages crawled by
                                              the CommonCrawl foundation over the 2013-2024
                                              time period. We then extracted the main page text
                                              from the HTML of each webpage, filtered each
                                              sample and deduplicated each individual Common-
                                              Crawl dump/crawl.
Data processing steps                         The data processing pipeline consists of:
                                              - URL filtering
                                              - Trafilatura text extraction
                                              - FastText language filter
                                              - MassiveText repetition and quality
                                              ,→  filters

                                              For FineWeb-Edu, we further apply a filtering step
                                              based on our educational content classifier.
Annotations                                   We augment the original samples with
                                              the     language,       language_score        and
                                              tokens_count annotations.          The language
                                              related annotations are automatically generated by
                                              our language filter. token_count is generated by
                                              applying the GPT-2 tokenizer to the text column.
Personal and Sensitive Information            We anonymize email addresses and public IP ad-
                                              dresses using regex patterns.

                                 Considerations for Using the Data
 Social Impact of Dataset                           With the release of FineWeb, we aim to make LLM
                                                    training more accessible to the machine learning
                                                    community by:
                                                    (a) making the dataset creation process more trans-
                                                    parent, by sharing our entire processing setup in-
                                                    cluding the codebase used
                                                    (b) helping alleviate the costs of dataset curation,
                                                    both in time and in compute, for model creators by
                                                    publicly releasing our dataset with the community.
 Biases                                             Efforts were made to minimize the amount of
                                                    NSFW and toxic content present in the dataset
                                                    by employing filtering on the URL level. However,
                                                    there are still a significant number of documents
                                                    present in the final dataset that could be consid-
                                                    ered to be toxic or contain harmful content. As
                                                    FineWeb was sourced from the web as a whole,
                                                    any harmful biases typically present in the web
                                                    may be reproduced on our dataset. Bias analy-
                                                    ses for sensitive subgroups demonstrate that ‘man’
                                                    is more common in the dataset than other gender
                                                    terms, ‘christian’ is more common than other re-
                                                    ligion terms. The disproportionate association of
                                                    specific terms to sensitive subgroups is relatively
                                                    low, with the most notable bias that some religion
                                                    terms tend to be more associated with online dating
                                                    terms. We provide a more detailed bias analysis
                                                    in Section 5.
 Other Known Limitations                            As a consequence of some of the filtering steps
                                                    applied, it is likely that code content is not preva-

E     Deduplication
E.1   Deduplication parameters

As mentioned in Section 3.4, we use 5-grams and 112 hash functions for our MinHash deduplication.
Each 5-gram is hashed with each of the 112 hash functions, and a document signature is obtained by
taking the minimum hash value (minhash) across all 5-grams for each hash function. We further split
the resulting 112 minhashes into 14 buckets of 8 hashes each. Documents are matched if they have
the same 8 minhashes in at least one of the 14 buckets.
With these parameters, the probability that two documents with a n-gram similarity (s) of 0.7, 0.75,
0.8 and 0.85 would be identified as duplicates would be 56%, 77%, 92% and 98.8%, respectively.
This split therefore will match documents that are at least 75% similar with a high probability, and
almost guarantee that documents with similarities of 85% or above will be matched. These values
can be computed by taking the following probabilities: that the two documents would have the same
value for a given hash function, s; that they do not have the same 8 minhashes in one bucket, 1 − s8 ;
that they do not have the same 8 minhashes in any of the 14 buckets, (1 − s8 )14 ; and finally that they
have the same 8 minhashes on at least one of the 14 buckets, 1 − (1 − s8 )14 .
See Fig. 13 for a match probability comparison between our setup with 112 hashes and the one from
RefinedWeb, with 9000 hashes, divided into 450 buckets of 20 hashes.
While the high number of hash functions in RefinedWeb allows for a steeper, more well-defined cut
off (document pairs with similarity near the threshold are more likely to be correctly identified), this

larger number of hash functions also requires a substantially larger amount of compute resources, as
each individual hash must be computed, stored, and then compared with hashes from other documents.
We believe the compute and storage savings make up for the higher uncertainty on documents near
the threshold.

E.2   Measuring the effect of deduplication

Given the nature of deduplication, its effect is not always visible in a smaller slice of the dataset (such
as 28B tokens, the size used for our filtering ablations). Furthermore, there are specific effects at
play when deduplicating across different Common Crawl dumps, as some URLs and webpages are
recrawled from one snapshot to the next.

         Dataset fraction

                                                                                 Sample size

                    # duplicates                                          1            3             8-16
                                                                          2            4-8           16-32
Figure 14: Small ablations are ineffective for deduplication analysis. The chart displays the distribution of
document repetitions across different sample sizes (1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion, 350 billion, and 1 trillion
tokens) from a dataset of 20T tokens.



                                                                                  22
To visualize the effect of scaling the number of training tokens when measuring deduplication impact,
we simulated creating different-sized subsets of randomly sampled documents from the full dataset
under the following extreme conditions: there are 100 snapshots, where each one is made up of
unique documents with a total of 200 billion tokens (yielding our total of 20 trillion from Section 3.4),
and each snapshot is an exact copy of each other (worst case scenario for inter snapshot duplication).
In Fig. 14, we can see that for a 1 billion subset, almost all documents would be unique (#duplicates=1),
despite each document being repeated 100 times in the full dataset. At the 100 billion scale (0.5% of
the total dataset), there starts to be a larger number of documents being repeated twice, and a few
even 4-8 times. At the larger scale of 1 trillion (5% of the total dataset), the majority of the documents
are repeated up to 8 times, with some being repeated up to 16 times. This simulation illustrates the
inherent difficulties with measuring deduplication impact on the training of larger LLMs once the
largest duplicate clusters have been removed. We ran our performance evaluations for deduplicated
data at the 350 billion scale, which would, under this theoretical scenario, be made up of a significant
portion of documents duplicated up to 8 times.

Figure 15: URL and Line-wise deduplication study. None of the attempted deduplication methods outperform
individual deduplication.

To attempt to improve performance on top of independently deduplicating each snapshot, we experi-
mented with applying other “lighter” global deduplication methods to all the individually MinHash
deduplicated snapshots (comprising 20 trillion tokens of data).
We explored URL deduplication, where we only kept one document per normalized (lowercased)
URL (71.5% of tokens removed, 5.6 trillion left) — FineWeb URL dedup. Different line-based
deduplication variations were also considered: remove all but 1 (randomly chosen) occurrence of
each duplicated line (77.8% of tokens dropped, 4.4 trillion left) — FineWeb line dedup; same as
above, but only removing duplicate lines with at least 10 words and dropping documents with fewer
than 3 sentences after deduplication (85% of tokens dropped, 2.9 trillion left) — FineWeb line dedup
w/ min words; and remove all but 1 occurrence of each span of 3 duplicated lines with each number
treated as 0 when finding duplicates, (80.9% of tokens removed, 3.7 trillion left) — FineWeb 3-line
dedup.
As can be seen in Fig. 15 the performance of the models trained on each of these methods was
consistently worse (albeit to different degrees) than that of the original individually deduplicated data.
We therefore did not apply any additional deduplication beyond individual-snapshot MinHash-based
deduplication.

F.1   Annotation Prompt

We use the following prompt template to generate document annotations using the Llama3 model:

         Below is an extract from a web page. Evaluate whether the page has a high educational
        value and could be useful in an educational setting for teaching from primary school to
         grade school levels using the additive 5-point scoring system described below. Points are
         accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:
        - Add 1 point if the extract provides some basic information relevant to educational top-
         ics, even if it includes some irrelevant or non-academic content like advertisements and
         promotional material.
        - Add another point if the extract addresses certain elements pertinent to education but
         does not align closely with educational standards. It might mix educational content with
         non-educational material, offering a superficial overview of potentially useful topics, or
         presenting information in a disorganized manner and incoherent writing style.
        - Award a third point if the extract is appropriate for educational use and introduces key
         concepts relevant to school curricula. It is coherent though it may not be comprehensive
         or could include some extraneous information. It may resemble an introductory section of
         a textbook or a basic tutorial that is suitable for learning but has notable limitations like
         treating concepts that are too complex for grade school students.
        - Grant a fourth point if the extract highly relevant and beneficial for educational purposes
         for a level not higher than grade school, exhibiting a clear and consistent writing style. It
         could be similar to a chapter from a textbook or a tutorial, offering substantial educational
         content, including exercises and solutions, with minimal irrelevant information, and the
         concepts aren’t too advanced for grade school students. The content is coherent, focused,
         and valuable for structured learning.
        - Bestow a fifth point if the extract is outstanding in its educational value, perfectly suited for
         teaching either at primary school or grade school. It follows detailed reasoning, the writing
         style is easy to follow and offers profound and thorough insights into the subject matter,
         devoid of any non-educational or complex content.
        The extract: <EXAMPLE>.
        After examining the extract:
        - Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.
        - Conclude with the score using the format: "Educational score: <total points>"

F.2   Additional results

Fig. 16 compares FineWeb-Edu to other open web datasets on 9 becnhmarks, using a 1.71B model
trained on 350 billion tokens. Additionally, Fig. 17 displays the results of experiments with various
filtering thresholds for building FineWeb-Edu, using a 1.71B model trained on 28 billion tokens. Our
findings indicate that a threshold of 3 yields the best average performance.

To begin, we examine the distribution over subgroup terms for gender (Fig. 19) age (Fig. 20), and
religion (Fig. 21) in a subset of FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu randomly sampled from the whole dataset,
of around 10 Billion GPT-2 tokens (FineWeb 10BT and FineWeb-Edu 10BT). Terms used are shown
in Table 4 and are all normalized to lowercase for this analysis.
We find that ‘man’ appears much more frequently than ‘woman’ and ‘non-binary’, and ‘christian’
appears much more frequently than all other religions terms tested.

G.2     Association Analysis

We next examine the skews with respect to the different subgroup terms, as measured by TF-IDF [78].
This method is described as capturing the specificity of words in the dataset, here applied as specificity
with respect to the terms for the different subgroups. This provides a way to quantify how “biased”
each subgroup term is with respect to the words they co-occur with. Specifically, given the dataset
and terms for a subgroup of interest, we:

        1. Build a vocabulary of all words that occur at least twice in the dataset.
        2. Extract all data instances where the subgroup term is present.
        3. Compute the TF-IDF for all words in the vocabulary that co-occur in the same documents
           as a given subgroup term.
        4. Compute the difference between the TF-IDF for the given subgroup terms and the average
           TF-IDF of all other words they co-occur with.
        5. Extract the words co-occurring with the given subgroup terms with a TF-IDF greater than 0.

G.2.1     Gender
We find that ‘man’ is associated with terms such as ‘god’, ‘police’, ‘said’ and ‘good’, ‘woman’
is associated with terms like ‘said’, ‘women’, ‘police’, ‘life’, ‘love’, ‘dating’ and ‘family’, and
‘non-binary’ is associated with ‘gender’ and LGBTQIA+ terms such as ‘trans’, ‘transgender’, and
‘queer’ (Fig. 22). Applying this same analysis to FineWeb-Edu-Sample-10BT, we find that ‘man’
is associated with the term ‘god’, and slightly associated with terms like ‘war’, ‘great’, and ‘king’.
‘woman’ is associated with terms like ‘pregnancy’, ‘cancer’, ‘mother’, ‘children’, and ‘family’.

G.2.2     Religion
Throughout, we see skews towards words associated with online intimacy: ‘online’, ‘singles’, ‘sex’,
‘mature’, ‘girls’. As can be seen in Fig. 27, ‘jewish’ is particularly associated with ‘dating‘ and
‘singles’. ‘muslim’, ‘jewish’, ‘hindu’ and ‘buddhist’ are slightly skewed to co-occur with ‘women’,
while ‘sex’ is skewed with ‘muslim’, ‘christian’, ‘jewish’; and ‘girl’ with ‘muslim’, ‘jewish’, ‘hindu’.

G.2.3     Age
The word ‘young’ is skewed to co-occur with ‘women’, consistent with the problematic tendencies in
English-speaking societies to infantilize women and over-indexing on womens’ youth [79, 80]. We
also see expected skews, such as ‘young’ co-occurring with words like ‘children’ and ‘school’.
